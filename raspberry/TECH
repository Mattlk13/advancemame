AdvanceBERRY
============

AdvanceBERRY is built upon the Raspbian Buster 32-bit distribution.

It is tailored for a quick boot, ensuring readiness within 15 seconds of 
powering up your Raspberry Pi.

It also removes all the boot messages and instead displays a splash screen at
startup.

Beyond these modifications, it functions as a full Raspbian distribution.


How to access the system
========================

To access the Linux command line, press ALT+F2, and log in with the username 
'pi' and password 'advance'.

For halting the AdvanceMENU frontend, first press SCROLL-LOCK to unlock it. 
Then, press ESC to select 'Exit'.

If the terminal becomes unresponsive, press 'CTRL+C' to regain control. To 
display the cursor again, use the cursor.sh script.


How to add ROMs and other files
===============================

ROM files should be placed in the following directory:

    /opt/advance/share/advance/rom

The simplest method is to insert the microSD card into a Linux system,
mount the second partition (usually labeled as "rootfs"), and copy the
ROM files directly into the `rom` directory.

You can also add additional media files. Samples should go into the "sample"
directory, artworks in the "artwork" directory, screenshots and clips into
the "snap" directory, all located under:

    /opt/advance/share/advance/

These folders follow the standard structure used by AdvanceMENU and
AdvanceMAME, and files placed here will be automatically recognized.


Bluetooth
=========

Bluetooth pairing support is facilitated by the advblue daemon, started at
boot. If troubleshooting is required, terminate the original daemon with
'killall advblue' and then launch it in foreground mode using 'advblue -f'.

This allows you to observe the communication between advblue and the 
'bluetoothctl' tool, which is employed for listing and pairing devices.


Gamepad
=======

When a gamepad is connected, you can verify button mapping correctness with 
the 'advj' tool. It displays the real-time input of pressed buttons.

If the mapping is incorrect, consider submitting your mapping to libretro. 
AdvanceMAME utilizes the libretro mappings available in the "udev" directory 
at:

	:https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-joypad-autoconfig

Although using these configuration files directly is currently not feasible,
a future version of the AdvanceMAME binary should be included in the image.


Internals
=========

The Advance programs are installed in /opt/advance. 

The configuration .RC files are in the /home/pi/.advance directory.

The startup logic is in the /home/pi/.profile script.

AdvanceMAME runs directly on the Linux framebuffer, without relying on the X
graphical environment. This setup allows it to use hardware acceleration for
scaling and multiple CPU cores for emulation and visual effects, delivering
efficient performance.

Only AdvanceMAME and the Linux kernel are active, communicating directly
without intermediate libraries like SDL. This lean setup ensures minimal
overhead and maximum responsiveness.

Graphical effects are calibrated at runtime. The system initially attempts to
use the XBR effect, and if performance is insufficient (though it usually
handles it well), it automatically falls back to faster alternatives such as
Scale2k or Scale2x.

None of these effects are GPU shaders, they are implemented directly within
AdvanceMAME. GPU shader-based effects, such as XBR when implemented as a
shader, are generally too demanding for a Raspberry Pi and tend to negatively
impact emulation speed.
